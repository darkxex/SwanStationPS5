## Native build dependencies

The application build uses LLVM/Clang/lld, zlib 1.3.2, and the public
[PS5 payload SDK](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/sdk). The bootstrapper
downloads SDK v0.42 after verifying SHA-256
`8cfbc7cd5811e719eb4f0c47eea668d3dc7b40bc8ab11c4a5031d40c23ec02da`.
It downloads zlib 1.3.2 from the upstream source archive after verifying
SHA-256 `bb329a0a2cd0274d05519d61c667c062e06990d72e125ee2dfa8de64f0119d16`
and compiles its static archive locally. Both dependencies remain under ignored
`.deps/native/`, retain their upstream licenses, and are not distributed by
this repository. No Sony SDK file is included.

Target C++ compilation uses the LLVM libc++ headers distributed by the public
SDK. Those headers retain the Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception license recorded
upstream. The application does not redistribute or dynamically load the
complete libc++ or libc++abi archives.

The PS5 ELF converter and FSELF writer in `tooling/native/` are derived from
[SharpProspero](https://github.com/SvenGDK/SharpProspero), Copyright (C) 2026
SvenGDK, GPL-3.0, and were translated to C++ and modified by BlackBearReloaded.

## Host test dependency

The host unit-test target downloads
[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) 1.17.0 after verifying
SHA-256 `65fab701d9829d38cb77c14acdc431d2108bfdbf8979e40eb8ae567edf10b27c`.
It remains under ignored `.deps/test/`, retains its BSD-3-Clause license, and
is not linked into any PS5 application, runtime, or package artifact.

## Optional PS5-Lapy-JB-Daemon integration

The sandbox-elevation build fetches
[mpereiraesaa's PS5-Lapy-JB-Daemon](https://github.com/mpereiraesaa/PS5-Lapy-JB-Daemon)
at commit `54a095c0f19161825e845daa760a03b446e654fa`, invokes its unmodified
`owned-helper` target for the selected application's exact title and packages
the generated helper ELF with Lapy's MIT license. The shared protocol header
published upstream is LGPL-2.1-or-later; this repository's application-side
wire implementation is GPL-3.0-or-later.

Lapy was created by
[ArkSama / Team PHU](https://github.com/ArkSama/PS5-Lapy-JB-Daemon). Credit
belongs to ArkSama, mpereiraesaa and the Lapy contributors. No Lapy kernel
source is copied or modified here.

The helper build also uses the pinned `ps5log/1` header from
[mpereiraesaa/ps5-agc-gears](https://github.com/mpereiraesaa/ps5-agc-gears/tree/1ae1f9182abd2770c131b97419034fb85173c2dc/native/ps5log),
GPL-3.0-or-later, and the official PS5 Payload SDK v0.40. Those build inputs
remain under ignored `.deps/lapy/`; the normal application toolchain remains
the separately pinned Payload SDK v0.42.

## Optional PacBrew dependencies

When selected through `PACBREW_*` build variables, the build downloads the prebuilt ports image
from [ps5-payload-dev/pacbrew-repo](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/pacbrew-repo)
release `v0.40.2`, verifies its published SHA-256, and extracts only the
`target/user/homebrew` prefix under ignored `.deps/pacbrew/`. It does not
replace the pinned SDK or install files globally. PacBrew recipes and every
linked third-party library retain their upstream licenses; applications must
review those terms before redistribution.

The update-check example (`make update-check-example`) selects `libcurl`, which
statically links these PacBrew libraries into the example title. Its build
output stays under ignored `dist/` and is not distributed by this repository; an
application that ships the update check ships them and must carry their notices:

| Component | Version in PacBrew v0.40.2 | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [libcurl](https://curl.se/) | 8.18.0 | curl license (MIT/X derivative) |
| [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) | 3.5.2 | Apache License 2.0 |
| [zlib](https://zlib.net/) | 1.3.2 | zlib license |
| [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) | 1.5.6 | BSD-3-Clause (dual-licensed with GPL-2.0) |
| [libpsl](https://github.com/rockdaboot/libpsl) | 0.21.5 | MIT; built-in Public Suffix List data MPL-2.0 |

`examples/update-check/console_curl.c`, which makes these libraries run in a
native title, is original BlackBearReloaded code (GPL-3.0-or-later), taken from
the ProsperoRadio and ProsperoLichess projects. Its `gmtime_r` follows Howard
Hinnant's public-domain `civil_from_days` algorithm.

## Vendored miniz

`third_party/miniz/` holds [miniz](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz) 3.0.2
(commit `293d4db1b7d0ffee9756d035b9ac6f7431ef8492`), MIT, unmodified, with its
`LICENSE`; `SOURCE.json` records each file's SHA-256. Only the self-update
helper (`examples/self-update-helper`) and its host test link it; an
application that ships that helper ships miniz and must carry its notice. The
helper's archive validation and file helpers are original BlackBearReloaded
code (GPL-3.0-or-later), taken from the ProsperoStore project.

## Optional UFS2Tool dependency

When `.ffpkg` output is requested, the platform bootstrapper fetches
[SvenGDK/UFS2Tool](https://github.com/SvenGDK/UFS2Tool) at commit
`b5307a60d5b4e3a68ba680e0e33cfadf05017c77` into the ignored
`.deps/UFS2Tool` cache and builds it with the host .NET SDK. UFS2Tool is
BSD-2-Clause software and is not distributed by this repository.

## Optional MkPFS dependency

When `.ffpfsc` output is requested, the platform bootstrapper fetches
[PSBrew/MkPFS](https://github.com/PSBrew/MkPFS) at commit
`6cb8313dfe0c988ac52617794553f343243d3a56` into the ignored `.deps/MkPFS`
cache and installs its Python dependencies into an ignored virtual environment
there. MkPFS and its dependencies retain their own licenses and are not
distributed by this repository.

## Independently authored runtime shim

`tooling/native/libc_builder.cpp` and the manifests under
`tooling/native/runtime/` are independently authored for this project and
licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later. The generated `runtime/libc.prx` contains
project-authored compatibility stubs, startup code, and semantic loader
metadata. It contains no Sony runtime implementation.

Original ps5-native-app-boilerplate code is Copyright (C) 2026
BlackBearReloaded and licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later. Source and script files
carry matching SPDX identifiers.

## Original presentation assets

The BlackBear icon, selection artwork, and default selection track
`sce_sys/snd0.at9` are original assets supplied by BlackBearReloaded, Copyright
(C) 2026 BlackBearReloaded, and distributed under GPL-3.0-or-later. The track
is titled `Night Drive`.

No proprietary runtime module, encryption key, or game file is included.
